If you are not familiar with [Tailwind CSS], you can think of [Windi CSS] as a utility-first CSS library.

## Why Windi CSS? ðŸ¤”

A quote from the author should illustrate his motivation to create [Windi CSS]:

> When my project became larger and there were about dozens of components, the initial compilation time reached 3s, and hot updates took more than 1s. @voorjar

By scanning your HTML and CSS and generating utilities on demand, [Windi CSS] is able to provide [faster load times][video comparison] and a speedy HMR in development, and does not require purging in production.

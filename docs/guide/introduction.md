# Introduction

[__Windi CSS__][windicss] is a next generation compiler for [Tailwind CSS].

If you are already familiar with [Tailwind CSS], think about [Windi CSS] as an alternative to Tailwind, which provides faster load times, and supports all the features in Tailwind v2.0 and more.

If you are not familiar with [Tailwind CSS], you can think of [Windi CSS] as a utility-first CSS library.

## Features ‚ö°Ô∏è

Everything you know and love about [Tailwind CSS], plus:

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Speed

It detects utilities and directives in your CSS, and process them on demand, which greatly improves the compilation speed. Windi only loads the CSS you use, no purging required!

#### üîå Compatibility

Windi supports Tailwind configuration files, directives, and utilities.

#### üòé Auto-Inferred Variables

No need to configure custom variables like numbers, sizes, scores, and colors. Windi CSS will automatically generate them based on the class semantics.

For example, `p-3.2` exists if you use it.

#### ‚úÖ Native Cross-Browser Support

The generated CSS for all utilities is already cross-browser compatible, so there is no need to use [autoprefixer] unless you want to.
